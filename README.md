# NewsByte

## Overview

NewsByte is a comprehensive sentiment analysis application designed to analyze news articles related to a specific company. It leverages web scraping, Large Language Models (LLMs), sentiment analysis, and text-to-speech (TTS) to provide a detailed and insightful sentiment summary. NewsByte offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a user-friendly Streamlit web application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each with a specific responsibility:

- **`config.py`:** Centralized configuration for logging and debug mode.
- **`analysis.py`:** Performs sentiment analysis and data manipulation of news articles.
- **`tts.py`:** Handles text-to-speech (TTS) conversion, specifically for Hindi.
- **`llm.py`:** Manages interactions with the Large Language Model (LLM) for summarization and comparative analysis.
- **`api.py`:** Implements a FastAPI server exposing the NewsByte pipeline as a RESTful API.
- **`cli.py`:** Provides a command-line interface to run the NewsByte pipeline.
- **`utils.py`:** Contains utility functions for file handling and string manipulation.
- **`app.py`:** A Streamlit application providing a user interface to the API.
- **`data_models.py`:** Defines Pydantic data models for structured data handling.
- **`scraping.py`:** Handles web scraping of news articles using Google Search.

## Dependencies

The project relies on several Python libraries. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include at least the following:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
pydantic
requests
beautifulsoup4
newspaper3k
trafilatura
langdetect
nltk
transformers
streamlit
streamlit-extras
kokoro
googletrans==4.0.0-rc1  # Important: Specify googletrans version due to potential conflicts
soundfile
numpy
argparse
outlines
openai
```

You will also need to set the `NEWSBYTE_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key.

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Run the analysis from the command line:

```bash
python cli.py <company_name> [number_of_articles]
```

Replace `<company_name>` with the name of the company you want to analyze. The `number_of_articles` is optional; it defaults to 10. The output is saved to a JSON file named after the company (in snake_case).

### Streamlit Web Application

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

And in another terminal:

```bash
uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

This launches a web application where you can interactively input a company name and step through the analysis process.

## Model Details

### Summarization Model

- **Model:** `deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` model used for summarization and topic extraction using OpenRouter API.
- **Implementation:** The `llm.py` module handles article summarization using prompts and the `outlines` module for structured JSON generation to extract key information from news articles.
- **Framework:** Uses the Outlines library for JSON schema validation and structured generation
- **Error Handling:** Implements a retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts) with JSON repair for malformed LLM outputs
- **Validation:** Uses Pydantic models defined in `data_models.py` to validate and structure LLM responses
- **Configuration:** Model used can be adjusted as a variable in `api.py`.

### Sentiment Analysis Model

- **Model:** `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` model from Hugging Face
- **Implementation:** The `analysis.py` module processes article text to determine sentiment polarity
- **Categories:** Sentiment is classified into four categories: "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", and "Unknown"
- **Features:** Provides sentiment scores for positive, negative, neutral and unknown sentiments.
- **Pipeline:** Uses the Hugging Face `transformers` pipeline for inference

### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Model

- **Model:** `hexgrad/Kokoro-82M` used for open-source, efficient TTS in Hindi.
- **Implementation:** The `tts.py` module handles conversion of text to speech specifically optimized for Hindi.
- **Translation:** Uses the `googletrans` library (version 4.0.0-rc1) for English to Hindi translation
- **Output:** Generates audio files in `.wav` format that can be played in the web application or saved locally.

## API Development

### FastAPI Server (api.py)

The application exposes a RESTful API through a FastAPI server that follows the NewsByte pipeline steps.

## Data Flow

The NewsByte pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Web Scraping (`scraping.py`):** Fetches news articles about the specified company from Google Search.
2. **Summarization and Topic Extraction (`llm.py`):** Uses an LLM to generate summaries and extract key topics from each article.
3. **Sentiment Analysis (`analysis.py`):** Performs sentiment analysis on the article summaries.
4. **Comparative Sentiment Analysis (`llm.py`):** Uses an LLM to compare sentiment across articles, identifying trends and differences.
5. **Final Sentiment Analysis (`llm.py`):** Generates a concise, investor-oriented summary of the overall sentiment.
6. **Translation and TTS (`tts.py`):** Translates the final analysis into Hindi and generates an audio file.
7. **Output (`cli.py`, `app.py`):** Presents the results via CLI or Streamlit web app, including the audio file. Results are also saved to a JSON file.

### Assumptions

- **Internet Connectivity:** The application assumes a stable internet connection for web scraping and API access
